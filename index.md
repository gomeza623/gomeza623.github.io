# Hi, I'm Anthony
I'm a PhD student at UC Berkeley's School of Social Welfare. My work focuses on the instrumental and emotional needs of parents and caregivers as a way to understand how to best promote systemic practices that prevent child welfare system involvement. Much of my research is shaped by my professional experiences working in home visiting, early education, and a group home for youth in foster care.
